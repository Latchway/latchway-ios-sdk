# Developer-supplied identity (1.3.0)

The application authenticates its user. Latchway accepts the resulting ID token,
verifies it through the gateway, and owns device-bound shared native sessions.
Core, App Attest and the React Native bridge do not depend on Firebase.

```swift
import Latchway
import LatchwayAppAttest

let app = try await LatchwayApp.configure(.init(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://gateway.example.com")!,
    applicationID: "your-latchway-application-id",
    environment: "development",
    rootKeychainAccessGroup: "YOURTEAM.your.signed.bundle.id",
    suppliedIdentity: try .firebaseProject(projectID: "your-project-id")
))

// Existing application auth code obtains this token; Latchway imports no Auth SDK.
let account = try await app.signIn { try await yourAuth.currentIDToken() }
let client = try await account.makeClient()

// Existing auth flow obtained a new token for the SAME account.
try await account.updateIdToken { try await yourAuth.currentIDToken() }

// Offline Latchway logout, shared by RN and native. External auth logout is yours.
try await app.signOut()
```

Already have a current token? Use `app.signIn(idToken:)` and
`account.updateIdToken(_:)`. Async producers capture a native transition ticket
before token retrieval; cancelling the Swift task invalidates pending work.

For a non-Firebase gateway-supported issuer, use
`LatchwaySuppliedIdentityConfiguration(providerID:issuer:audience:tenantID:)`.
`firebaseProject` only derives public issuer/audience values; it does not fetch,
persist or validate the signature of a token. The gateway authenticates tokens.

## Either team can configure first

Equivalent `configure` calls join one process-wide native app. Omitted settings
inherit existing settings. Conflicting explicit settings fail without replacing
the account. Native and RN must use the same gateway/application/environment,
JWT metadata, root Keychain group and platform policy. No owner transfer or
native-team Latchway bootstrap is needed. A second surface joins with
`try await app.makeClient()` or `try await app.currentAccount()` without signing in.

The App Attest module supplies the default attestation factory through the
two-argument `configure` overload. Apps still enable App Attest and provide the
actual signed root Keychain group. Unknown legacy extension/custom stores still
require explicit migration inventory; do not supply an invented empty list.

## Account and token lifetime

- ID tokens remain in native memory only, never Keychain or diagnostics. An
  RN-created account therefore survives JS destruction while its token is fresh.
- Missing/expired identity yields `identityRefreshRequired`; it does not log out.
  A same-user gateway-verified update resumes that account. The SDK cannot refresh
  an external provider token or observe a sign-out the app did not report.
- Forward external sign-out/account changes through these APIs. Keep one
  application auth lifecycle, not independent screen-owned login listeners.
- `app.restore` resumes only an unretired matching account or a fresh app. It
  never undoes a persisted logout; a later accepted login calls `signIn` explicitly.
- A new user requires `signIn`, which retires the previous account first. Old
  account handles cannot refresh or log out a later user, including A → B → A.
- Closing a client releases that client only. `app.signOut()` fences native
  and RN requests and components without resetting server per-user quotas.
- Serialize your provider's account mutations; Latchway does not call Firebase
  `signOut`, register hidden listeners, or control third-party auth changes.

## Sign out and sign in again

```swift
try await app.signOut()
// Your authentication provider manages its own sign-out/sign-in separately.
let nextAccount = try await app.signIn { try await yourAuth.currentIDToken() }
```

No account lookup or generation snapshot is required. The app-level operation
handles an active account, expired identity, an unfinished first sign-in,
persisted account state after restart, and an already signed-out app. Native and
React Native use the same registered app: signing out from either retires that
shared account. Pending token producers are fenced; even a producer that ignores
cancellation cannot publish its late result or erase a newer sign-in.

Wait for successful completion before signing in again. Concurrent sign-outs
join the same cleanup. A Keychain/cleanup failure throws `cleanupRequired` and
keeps requests and new sign-in blocked; retry `try await app.signOut()` after the
storage becomes available. A cleanup timeout leaves its drain running safely;
the next call joins or completes that retirement. `restore` cannot undo a
recorded logout; explicit `signIn` is required, including for the same user.

Cleanup removes the SDK's account refresh credentials, cached client sessions,
supplied identity token and registered component credentials, and fences active
or buffered response streams. It does not call Firebase or another identity
provider, reset per-user quotas, revoke the server installation, or erase
unrelated Keychain entries. Non-secret generation/logout tombstones, hashed
account/retention metadata and account-scoped installation/component/App Attest
key identity remain under the existing bounded retention policy. In-flight
caller-owned token strings cannot be erased by the SDK.

Existing `account.logout()` remains useful for delayed callbacks that must
target only their captured login; an old handle never signs out a newer account.

## Server requirements

Use server 1.1.1 or later. Shared mode uses wire 3 with required native-host attestation and allowed shared
callers. Discovery must advertise `supplied_identity_v1` and the canonical
`/client/v1/sessions/identity` endpoint. Unsupported servers fail explicitly.
Initial sign-in establishes an attested session. Token updates prove possession
of its refresh grant and the installation's DPoP key and verify the new token;
they do not rotate keys, change users or reset quotas. Refresh credentials that
have expired require attested re-establishment without reviving a retired login.

The legacy authority APIs remain available, but are a separate mode. A live
custom/JS-owned registration is never silently replaced by supplied identity.
