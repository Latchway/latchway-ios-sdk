# Developer-supplied identity (1.2.0)

The application authenticates its user. Latchway accepts the resulting ID token,
verifies it through the gateway, and owns device-bound shared native sessions.
Core, App Attest and the React Native bridge do not depend on Firebase.

```swift
import Latchway
import LatchwayAppAttest

let app = try await LatchwayApp.configure(.init(
    baseURL: URL(string: "https://gateway.example.com")!,
    applicationID: "your-latchway-application-id",
    environment: "development",
    rootKeychainAccessGroup: "YOURTEAM.your.signed.bundle.id",
    suppliedIdentity: try .firebaseProject(projectID: "your-project-id")
))

// Existing application auth code obtains this token; Latchway imports no Auth SDK.
let account = try await app.signIn { try await yourAuth.currentIDToken() }
let client = try await account.makeClient()

// Existing auth flow obtained a new token for the SAME account.
try await account.updateIdToken { try await yourAuth.currentIDToken() }

// Offline Latchway logout, shared by RN and native. External auth logout is yours.
try await account.logout()
```

Already have a current token? Use `app.signIn(idToken:)` and
`account.updateIdToken(_:)`. Async producers capture a native transition ticket
before token retrieval; cancelling the Swift task invalidates pending work.

For a non-Firebase gateway-supported issuer, use
`LatchwaySuppliedIdentityConfiguration(providerID:issuer:audience:tenantID:)`.
`firebaseProject` only derives public issuer/audience values; it does not fetch,
persist or validate the signature of a token. The gateway authenticates tokens.

## Either team can configure first

Equivalent `configure` calls join one process-wide native app. Omitted settings
inherit existing settings. Conflicting explicit settings fail without replacing
the account. Native and RN must use the same gateway/application/environment,
JWT metadata, root Keychain group and platform policy. No owner transfer or
native-team Latchway bootstrap is needed. A second surface joins with
`try await app.makeClient()` or `try await app.currentAccount()` without signing in.

The App Attest module supplies the default attestation factory through the
two-argument `configure` overload. Apps still enable App Attest and provide the
actual signed root Keychain group. Unknown legacy extension/custom stores still
require explicit migration inventory; do not supply an invented empty list.

## Account and token lifetime

- ID tokens remain in native memory only, never Keychain or diagnostics. An
  RN-created account therefore survives JS destruction while its token is fresh.
- Missing/expired identity yields `identityRefreshRequired`; it does not log out.
  A same-user gateway-verified update resumes that account. The SDK cannot refresh
  an external provider token or observe a sign-out the app did not report.
- Forward external sign-out/account changes through these APIs. Keep one
  application auth lifecycle, not independent screen-owned login listeners.
- `app.restore` resumes only an unretired matching account or a fresh app. It
  never undoes a persisted logout; a later accepted login calls `signIn` explicitly.
- A new user requires `signIn`, which retires the previous account first. Old
  account handles cannot refresh or log out a later user, including A → B → A.
- Closing a client releases that client only. `account.logout()` fences native
  and RN requests and components without resetting server per-user quotas.
- Serialize your provider's account mutations; Latchway does not call Firebase
  `signOut`, register hidden listeners, or control third-party auth changes.

## Server requirements

Shared mode uses wire 3 with required native-host attestation and allowed shared
callers. Discovery must advertise `supplied_identity_v1` and the canonical
`/client/v1/sessions/identity` endpoint. Unsupported servers fail explicitly.
Initial sign-in establishes an attested session. Token updates prove possession
of its refresh grant and the installation's DPoP key and verify the new token;
they do not rotate keys, change users or reset quotas. Refresh credentials that
have expired require attested re-establishment without reviving a retired login.

The legacy authority APIs remain available, but are a separate mode. A live
custom/JS-owned registration is never silently replaced by supplied identity.
