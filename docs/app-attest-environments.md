# App Attest development and distribution

This guide requires gateway 1.1.3 or later. Upgrading the SDK does not change
an existing environment policy; an administrator must configure acceptance.

The Latchway environment name and Apple's App Attest environment are separate.
An application configured for Latchway `development` can be a locally signed
device build or a TestFlight build. No SDK environment-selection flag is needed.

## Server and signing setup

Set the gateway's `appAttest.environment` acceptance policy to `development`,
`production`, or `any`. `any` is a server value only: Apple's entitlement accepts
only `development` or `production`. Apple defaults development builds to its
sandbox; TestFlight and App Store distribution use production regardless of the
entitlement. See [Apple's entitlement reference](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment).

A typical setup accepts `any` in the Latchway Development environment and only
`production` in Production. Also allow the intended signing/distribution
categories and bundle versions on the gateway; accepting both Apple
environments does not bypass those independent restrictions. Native iOS and
React Native iOS must have matching server policy when both are enabled.

Keep the app's bundle ID, App ID prefix, signed App Attest capability and private
Keychain access group correct. Continue using the ordinary `LatchwayApp.configure`
and supplied-identity APIs. Do not select an Apple environment from `DEBUG`, add
it to evidence, disable App Attest, or install a test provider in application code.
The server verifies the actual Apple environment cryptographically. A genuine
Apple development attestation is not a Google Play simulated `debug` verdict.

## Switching build channels

Apple sandbox and production keys cannot be interchanged. If Apple rejects a
previously accepted key with `invalidKey` after a build replacement, the native
provider rotates it once, submits a new attestation, and marks the replacement
accepted only after a successful gateway exchange. A second failure stops the
operation. Native and RN use this same provider and account state; neither layer
implements a second recovery mechanism. [Apple's preparation guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/preparing-to-use-the-app-attest-service)

A gateway policy rejection does not itself rotate an accepted key. Fix the
gateway's environment/distribution policy or build signing rather than clearing
Keychain or repeatedly reinstalling. A produced but never accepted attestation
may later receive Apple's `invalidInput`; existing bounded recovery handles
that separate case. Transient Apple availability errors do not cause rotation.

## Verification checklist

- On a supported physical device, use a correctly signed local build to create
  a session and then an assertion-backed session against Development.
- Install a TestFlight build targeting the same Development environment and
  repeat; inspect redacted server diagnostics for the verified Apple environment.
- Verify a development proof is rejected by a production-only policy, and check
  policy narrowing also rejects previously accepted development evidence.
- Exercise native-first and RN-first shared configuration without a JS
  attestation flag or duplicate SDK copy.

The deterministic lifecycle tests cover recovery and persistence, not Apple's
live behavior. Simulators do not prove App Attest. Production release evidence
retains the separate [physical-device requirements](real-device-conformance.md).
